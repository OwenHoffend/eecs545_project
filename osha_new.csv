 Employee Is Caught By Fallen Trellis  Suffers Fractures ,At about 3:00 p.m. on July 9 2013 Employee #1 a foreman with Razmik Tarkhanian Dba Bridge Iron was securing a 22 ft wide by 65 ft long trellis between two buildings that were under construction. Employee #1 was working alone removing safety brackets with an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) from the column supporting the trellis. The trellis brackets were about 18 ft above the ground. Employee #1 noticed that the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest column was not straight. Employee #1 was the foreman responsible for safety and the proper installation of the trellis at the site. Employee #1 decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest column. When the bottom weld was cut the weight of the trellis was too great for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis. This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately two ft and trap Employee #1 between the trellis and the wall. Apparently the structural design of the structure was modified by an unqualified foreman when he removed structural welds. This caused the remaining welds to fail under the load and allow the structure to fall. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital and he was admitted for over 24 hours for chest and facial fractures.,collapse of object

There was no marking however on the side of the vault to the operator's right to indicate any lines entering it. The job being performed at the time of the accident was ""potholing"" for soil samples to test for chemical contamination. Because the lines entering the nearby vault had not been marked the operator assumed there were no cables where he was digging. As he dug he contacted conductors energized at 34.5 kilovolts approximately twelve inches below the surface. He had been well trained and as a result he stayed in the cab of his tractor until emergency crews deenergized the conductors. This took approximately 3 hours.

 Foreman'S Finger Is Amputated When Unguarded Saw Kicks Back ,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 11 2013 Employee #1 a carpenter foreman employed by Pacific Peninsula Group was performing interior carpentry at a residential construction site. He was using a Bosch 4000 stand-mounted benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4 inches high his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were severely cut. Emergency services were called and the Mountain View Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Stanford Hospital where he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger which had been completely severed past the first knuckle near the palm was surgically reattached. The left ring finger which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle also was reattached but during a return hospital visit this finger required surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to Cal/OSHA by the employer and also reported by the Mountain View Fire Department. In its subsequent investigation Cal/OSHA identified the employer as a construction management company performing as a general contractor for this residential apartment building project with tasks being performed by its own employees as well as subcontractors. The task Employee #1 was performing required two rip cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished piece because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches high. Employee #1 was working alone and no witness to the event was identified. The guard for the Bosch 4000 included a hood a splitter and an anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the site but Employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other anti-kickback attachments separate from the guard/hood available to install. He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and guiding the wood through the blade with his right hand positioned at the end of the wood length nearest to him and his left hand positioned on the top and at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push block or push stick at the saw and he did not make one to use. He stated that the first cut was almost complete and the blade was about to come out at the back side of the wood piece when the wood kicked back and shot past his right side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade before the cut but was pulled back partially by the kick-back or his hand movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard anti-kickback and spreader features of the Bosch 4000 were not separable. They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that the type of rip cut Employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices such as featherboards were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been installed. No protective devices such as featherboards or anti-kickback attachments were available or installed on the table saw during the time when the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were available during the time when the table saw was being used.,caught in/between objects

 Employee Is Killed When Struck By Vehicle ,At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10 2013 Employee #1 with Villager Construction Inc. with a coworker were using an asphalt milling machine (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the ground checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt using a handheld pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15 ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth checking the cut. The operator was on the top of the milling machine controlling the operation of the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a second coworker who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe working distance. A different company Protective Services Inc. (PSI) was responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate so that work could be conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed around 9:30 p.m. and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the overpass were milled out approximately 200 ft on each side Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the interstate approximately1 000 ft to a railroad overpass and began setting up to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the concrete median dividers inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel were approximately 12 ft wide so the milling machine made two passes since it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane. Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved traffic control set up and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long while operating. Employee #1 was guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten minutes into the first pass the milling machine operator noticed lights hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the status of the project. Then the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle was not equipped with a strobe as required in work zones. The operator turned and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone where Employee #1 was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a hospital by emergency personnel Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma lacerations fractures and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the traffic control set up all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly with all signage cone spacing tapering attenuators and lighting; all of the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr,traffic

These light poles which had been bolted onto the side of the bridge had broken off and fallen into the roadway after being struck during an accident earlier in the day. The weather was warm and clear with a temperature of 81 degrees. The work crew started removing the poles at approximately 2:00 p.m. after the police blocked off the section of the road they were working in. They had three poles to remove from this location. They used a 2012 Freightliner with a 2012 Altec Digger Derrick work body South Carolina license plate number P728016 48' boom extended FMCSA inspected December 2012 Equipment Number 5154 USDOT 278298. The boom of the Digger Derrick was used to pull the damaged poles up and place them on the rack of the truck. Employee #1 when subsequently interviewed stated that he had been trained to always secure the boom by lowering it completely down to the auger stow bracket before moving the truck. However on this occasion he left the boom elevated to approximately 5 feet at unknown length of extension so that Coworkers #3 and #4 could strap the poles down in the rack. Employee #1 said that he could not remember why he did not make sure that the boom was secured and resting in the auger stow bracket before getting off the operating station. Employee #1 said that all of the training he had received had taught him to make sure the boom was secured before moving the truck. Employee #1 and Employee #2 were in the Digger Derrick truck Coworker #1 was in a bucket truck Coworker #2 was in another bucket truck and Coworker #3 was in a pickup truck. They all began to proceed off the bridge travelling at a speed of approximately 30 MPH. Suddenly the boom on the Digger Derrick truck rose up and struck the Meeting Street sign which was 15 to 18 feet directly above the roadway and measured approximately 18 feet long by 3 feet high. The boom straightened out and the front of the Digger Derrick truck reared up. The Digger Derrick truck fell on its right (passenger) side and slid 30 to 40 feet down the side of the bridge. Then the boom swung around to the right and pulled the Digger Derrick truck off of the bridge. The Digger Derrick truck came down on its rear and fell 30 feet to the ground below on its left (driver) side. Coworkers #1 #2 and #3 stopped their trucks and looked over the bridge rail. Coworker #1 saw movement in the truck and phoned for emergency services. Then the three coworkers made their way down to the accident site. When they arrived the police and emergency medical service were onsite and the coworkers were unable to approach the truck. Employees #1 and #2 were transported to the hospital admitted and treated. The initial report on injuries indicated that Employee # 1 had two fractured ribs and fluid in his chest as well as a chipped bone in his shoulder. Employee #2 had cuts and bruises to his face and strains and bruises to his back shoulder and leg. Both employees required extensive surgeries and at the time of this report had not returned to work.,traffic

 Employee Is Injured When Ejected From Bucket ,"On December 6 2006 a three-person crew consisting of Employee #1 who was a lineman a foreman/groundsman and a traffic control flagman was removing communication lines and poles as part of a road-widening project in Visalia CA. The main line ran east/west with the subject white pole (""P1/gas treated"") located at the west side of an intersection where it received a ""T-line"" from the north. A guy was provided at mid-pole height opposite the ""T-line"". The wrecking operation had proceeded from the west to the subject pole. The foreman supported the conductor with a rope for lowering while Employee #1 who was elevated in a manbucket on the north side of the pole released the conductor/strand hanger. Just after the hanger was released the pole failed at a point between 18 inches and 24 inches above the guy attaching point. The ""T-line"" caused the line bearing the weight of the pole to pin Employee #1 against the bucket and render him unconscious. The foreman called emergency medical services and attempted to lower and move the aerial device which had become caught because of the lateral load. He then went to retrieve a digger with the capacity to lift the line but before he returned Employee #1 had regained consciousness and cut the strand. This released the lateral force and caused the boom to rebound and eject Employee #1 from the bucket. His personal fall arrest system prevented further injury. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was admitted for cervical and lumbar spinal fractures. The subsequent investigation determined that the root cause of the accident was a hidden defect in the utility pole which was guyed and appeared to be structurally sound. Because employees were not required to climb the pole inspection and ""Butt"" testing was not required. Inspection procedures would have required a visual appraisal in addition to driving nails and sounding of the pole at the first 2 feet above the ground. Employees demonstrated knowledge of safe procedures and of the hazards pertaining to wrecking operations. The employer had a well-devised and implemented safety and health program.",struck by moving objects
 Employee Electrocuted When Boom Strikes Power Line ,On November 7 2003 Employee #1 a laborer with C.A.C. Industries Inc. was operating a pile driver.

 Employee Killed When Bucket Truck Overturns ,Employee #1 was operating a Hi-Ranger bucket truck that was positioned behind a Manitowoc boom truck being operated by a coworker as they installed insulators on a cement pole. Employee #1 was just starting to lower the lower boom of the Hi-Ranger when the boom of the Manitowoc began to swing at a high speed to the right. The coworker grabbed the controller but it would not stop. The Manitowoc boom swung so fast that it put enough tension on the bucket truck boom to break the hold-back cable and continued to push the upper boom over. This released the leveling cables on the Hi-Ranger bucket truck and caused it to flip over throwing Employee #1 out of the cab. He fell to the ground and sustained fatal head injuries. When the remote controls were later tested the remote START button was hit and the swing controller actuator pulled the swing lever full right. When the emergency STOP button was hit it would kick out of neutral but when it was pulled on again the swing lever went to full swing right. There was apparently a malfunction with the controller. Further evaluation showed that the servo-actuator had also malfunctioned.,others

 Employee Killed When Caught By Boom Line Spool And Crushed ,A 225-ton American crawler crane was being demobilized for shipment. Employee #1 was helping to wind the boom line whip line and main load line onto their base spools. Because there were no loads on the lines they were resistant to being rolled and tended to overlap or lay unevenly. Employee #1 was standing in a 34 in. wide opening that was approximately 3 1/2 ft between the boom line and whip line spools and a metal guard/shield. The shield was an integral but not a structural part of the machine and it was intended to guard against workers falling into the rotating auxiliary shaft and clutch during normal maintenance of the crane. The whip line spool and boom line spool were on a common horizontal axis but rotated independently. The lines ran over the tops of the spools putting them slightly below Employee #1's head as they were drawn from the horizontal boom. He guided the lines as necessary to yield an even tight lay. By this point the whip line had been secured and the boom line was being spooled at 16 rpm. Employee #1 was standing on a metal floor and apparently was astride the continuously rotating auxiliary 5 in. diameter shaft. To one end of the shaft was attached a 27-in. diameter friction clutch which operated the whip line spool and was open on the side closest to the employee. Employee #1 had on a safety belt with a shoulder harness and lanyard. It appears that Employee #1's clothing or lanyard became caught in the rotating parts.

 Excavator Is Killed In Pressurized Release Of Grout And Rock ,On June 11 2012 Employee #1 of Vegas Tunnel Constructors Las Vegas NV was part of a swing shift crew excavating a tunnel. They were using a tunnel boring machine (TBM). The TBM had been excavating in closed mode for approximately 17 days. Closed mode is a term used to describe one of two modes of operation this TBM was capable of performing the other being open mode. Closed mode excavation involves the pressurization of the cutterhead and face of the TBM to support the ground and/or control excessive groundwater inflows. The position of the TBM found it excavating through a large vertical fault zone that later became the Detachment Fault. The ground conditions required the TBM face to be pressurized to approximately 13 bars of pressure. The grout being injected in the annular space was being pumped in at approximately 14 bars. The swing shift had begun work and was preparing to erect a ring segment set; Ring #135. The swing shift began to build Ring #135 at about 4:00 p.m. The first segment was successfully installed in the tunnel crown (top of the tunnel). The crew then began to install the second segment which was to be placed in front of the keystone of Ring #134. Three hydraulic rams including one abutting the keystone of Ring #134 were slowly retracted. Almost as soon as the retraction began a loud pop was heard. Some members of the crew reported hearing a second pop. The keystone for Ring #134 had shifted forward approximately 4 inches. The come-a-long did not hold the forces exerted and the gears were stripped out. This shift permitted grout and other materials such as rocks to escape the annulus at a pressure of approximately 14 bars (200 psi). Employee #1 was standing in front of the area where the gap developed. He was struck and killed by the moving grout and rocks. Coworkers found Employee #1 and removed him from the tunnel.,struck by moving objects

 Employee'S Thumb Is Amputated By Drill Shaft ,At approximately 12:30 p.m. on May 15 2007 Employee #1 was working at a site near Spring Road and Route 94 in Spring Valley CA. Also at the site were a coworker who was a drill operator and a foreman. All three employees were employed by a commercial contractor that specializes in street and traffic light installations in Southern California. Employee #1 was a locator who walked on the ground surface to locate the underground directional drill head using a detector unit to track the horizontal and angle movement of the drill head. This information was communicated back to the coworker who was the operator seated on the directional boring machine (a Vermeer Number D24x40 Horizontal Directional Drill). The horizontal directional drill was used to dig under cement pavement and earth to lay electrical lines for street and traffic lights. The head of the drill first made a path through the soil underneath the ground until it arrived at its destination. A line was then pulled through it so electrical lines could be installed to hookup traffic and signal lights for public streets and freeways. The front section of the horizontal directional boring machine was outfitted with a left and right anchor boring unit with stakes. The stakes were large auger units that tapped into the ground vertically to stabilize the machine when its drilling rods apparently ran horizontally underneath the ground. The bolt holding the auger bit to the shaft on the main frame of the directional boring machine came off and the coworker had to take it apart to get to the dislodged bolt. Apparently the coworker tightened the bolt got up on the directional boring machine seated himself and unsuccessfully attempted to line up the square piece fitting of the shaft over the top of the auger attachment. Employee #1 came over and used his left hand to try and line up the shaft while the coworker manipulated the controls in an attempt to attach the shaft to the auger bit. The shaft dropped on employee's #1 left thumb causing the top one inch to be amputated.

 Employee'S Arm Crushed By Falling Pipe ,"On May 12 2005 Employee #1 of Acorn Industrial Inc. was removing welds from a 30 in. CHR pipe in a utility tunnel so the pipe could be repositioned and re-welded in place. The pipe was normally suspended by permanent supports spaced throughout the tunnel as well as by temporary ""trapeze"" supports mounted to the ceiling and positioned to hold up the pipe where it was not adequately held by the permanent supports during installation. In the place where Employee #1 was working there was no permanent support in place. On the previous day a separate crew had received approval from the foreman and from Employee #1 to also remove the temporary support because this top run of pipe had been completely fit up and tack-welded in place at two joints: the west joint and the east joint. A subsequent inspection of the welds had revealed a misalignment of the pipe at the west joint. To correct this Employee #1 and the foreman decided to remove about 18 in. of the 30 in. CHR pipe at the west joint (including the misaligned weld) refit the two pipe ends and redo the weld at this location. The pipe was manually rolled to allow access to all portions of it due to the close proximity to the north wall. During the rolling of the pipe three tack welds at the west joint cracked; they were re-welded back in place but they cracked again during subsequent rolling of the pipe while the victim continued cutting the pipe at the east joint. After the tack welds cracked the second time the foreman and Employee #1 decided to start over at the west joint. At this point Employee #1 had completely severed the pipe at the east joint. The foreman told Employee #1 to check his rigging and grind out the remaining three tack welds at the west joint with a hand-held grinder. This would allow the crew to reposition the entire 30 in. CHR pipe and weld it back in place. The foreman left the area to continue layout for expansion joints in another vault and Employee #1 and his helper continued to work at the west joint. He ground out the three broken tack welds while they were at the bottom of the pipe instead of rolling the pipe to put the tack welds in a better position. At this point the only support for the pipe was the permanent support about 24 ft 4 in. away and approximately 12 ft of the pipe extended over the support structure near the east joint. The pipe was about 38 ft long before the removal of 18 in. at the east joint. Employee #1 was removing the tack welds from the bottom of the pipe when it fell crushing his right arm against the 30 in. CHS pipe below. He suffered injuries that required hospitalization. The temporary ""trapeze"" support would have adequately held the pipe's weight if it had been reinstalled when the workers realized they were going to remove the tack welds at the west joint and completely sever the pipe at the east joint. Employee #1 had been using a Ross ""come-a-long"" to help him shift/roll the pipe for the refit. The ""come-a-long"" was off center and therefore not in place to support the pipe; it could only provide offset force to shift or roll the pipe. -----",collapse of object

 Electric Shock ,Two plumbers were repairing broken pipes in a crawl space under a residence. The homeowner opened the house to allow the employees to enter and then the homeowner departed. The crew had determined on the previous day that the crawl space presented little space to work in and that the ground in the crawl space was wet. Consequently they decided to use hand tools only. There were five 177- by 355-millimeter vents around the crawl space perimeter. The workers made sure that the crawl space vents were open and clear. One of the workers entered the crawl space with a manual tubing cutter and a flashlight. (Both battery-powered and cord- and plug-connected electric tools were available on the work van.) He removed sections of plastic water line nearest the crawl space entry which was 787 millimeters wide and 330 millimeters high and moved further under the house. The two employees kept a running conversation as the first employee made his way into the crawl space. After the first employee had been inside the crawl space for approximately 7 to 8 minutes his coworker went to the van for additional parts. When the coworker returned to the house he heard the first employee screaming and thrashing about from an electric shock. The coworker called his office to request emergency medical services and then entered the crawl space to reach the injured employee. When he grabbed the injured employee's boot he found that the injured employee was trembling but unresponsive. The coworker cut a hole in the kitchen floor to reach the injured employee. However when emergency medical services arrived the emergency medical technicians pronounced him dead. He had been electrocuted. (The original form did not describe the source of the electric shock.,electrocution

When the employee loosened the hydraulic hose line in the front the bucket full of pea gravel slowly fell on the employee crushing him between the cab and the bucket of the Bobcat. The employee was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.,caught in/between objects
 Employee Electrocuted While Working In Crawl Space ,Employee #1 a handyman for a homeowner was working on a metal conduit in a crawl space when he was electrocuted. He was found on his back by his brother on September 4 2004 approximately three days after he had last been seen. A pair of wire cutters a 50-volt to 500-volt tester and tape were near the body. The conduit had two exposed power lines that were underneath Employee #1 but they were not energized. A test of the power lines showed that they may have been energized when Employee #1 was working on them but it was unclear. His wire cutters were also poorly insulated. Employee #1 sometimes did not work when he was supposed to or worked a few hours a day. Neither his brother nor the owner of the house who was building a small addition knew he was working in the crawl space. Employee #1 may have tripped a breaker switch causing a short or a member of the owner's family could have turned on the power for the circuit Employee #1 was working on unaware that he was in the crawl space.,electrocution
 Laborer Is Electrocuted While Picking Up An Elbow Connector ,On February 18 2009 Employee #1 a 21-year-old male with Thedford Construction Company was working at a job site with a damaged connector probe. The job foreman while digging a receiving pit at a transformer struck an underground 14.4 kV primary with the bucket of the excavator and pulled the load-break apparatus connector (#B7 elbow connector) from the transformer. This incident damaged the elbow connector probe. The foreman then instructed two laborers to pick-up the elbow connector and to repair the probe. The laborers retrieved a new elbow connector (probe probe installation tool and manufacturer's instructions included) from the company's truck. As one laborer attempted to use a shotgun stick (insulated live-line tool) to pick-up the elbow and cable the foreman became angry and told him to grab it with his hand. The laborer refused because the primary was still energized. The two laborers walked upstream to deenergize the power line. The foreman then directed Employee #1 who had just returned from the restroom to pick-up the elbow connector and to repair the probe. Employee #1 was wearing a damaged pair of Class-Three rubber insulating gloves and was electrocuted while trying to remove the broken probe from the elbow connector.,electrocution
 Electric Shock ,A power line worker was assigned to check on a power outage. He noticed that a 15-kilovolt cutout on a utility pole needed to be replaced. An energized part of the cutout was sitting on a transformer. The employee decided to remove the blown out part before covering up other live parts to remove the immediate hazard. As he removed this part he apparently contacted energized parts and received an electric shock. He was hospitalized for his injuries.,electrocution
 Employees Suffer Possible  Unconfirmed Exposure To Cyanide ,At about 1:50 p.m. on October 15 1994 employees of Fluor Daniels (F/D) the maintenance contractor for Rohm and Haas were removing an I-beam used as a monorail for a hoist in preparation for replacing a 100% hydrogen cyanide (HCN) tank. It had been reported that the N-5 unit was shut down but it later was found that the 2nd stage was recirculating while waiting for crude ACH from the N-3 unit. The 100% HCN tank next to which the F/D employees had been working had been washed 11 times since the Thursday before the incident. At about 1:50 p.m. a F/D pipefitter read 13 ppm on his personal monitox (cyanide monitor) so he went to the control room where an operator checked the area with a Drager HCN detector tube. Hydrogen cyanide was not detected and another monitox was given to the pipefitter. Employees were told that they could continue working. At about this time a pipefitter helper began feeling dizzy. About 20 minutes later the 2nd monitox indicated 161 ppm cyanide and the pipefitter took it back to the control room while the other F/D employees left the area. At this point the pipefitter began feeling very ill coughing up blood and experiencing difficulty breathing. Rohm and Haas used detector tubes to check the area again for HCN but it was not detected. The alarm was never sounded because detector tubes and the perimeter monitoring system indicated non-detection during the incident. The pipefitter was showered in the emergency shower and taken by ambulance to Southmore Hospital. His coworkers then went to the change house for showers. There two of the coworkers became ill. Later other F/D employees became ill. Belmont Construction Services employees had been working primarily in the KP area which was shut down so there was no methyl methacrylate present. By 6:00 p.m. some of their employees had become ill and passed out; some of them became ill on the bus that took them from the Belmont area to the contractors' gate. Fifteen Belmont employees were taken to the hospital and 13 stayed overnight for observation. In addition one Rohm and Haas employee and one Laidlaw employee who had been working in the West Waste Treatment Plant were hospitalized. Overall 34 employees from the four different companies were affected. Medical tests for Belmont Laidlaw F/D and Rohm and Haas employees all returned normal. The employees who left the plant site and were taken directly to the hospital were reportedly tested for cyanide in the blood within 20 minutes of the onset of known symptoms. Later tests could not substantiate a cyanide exposure but some employees' doctors stated that the employees had been exposed. The weather that day consisted of heavy rain and 100% humidity. The monitoxes were sent to the manufacturer who said that water was inside them and that they could not find traces of HCN on the monitoxes. An outside operator stated that she had had her monitox fail high after getting it wet or dropping it. The manufacturer's operating manual specifies operating limits of 20 to 95% relative humidity. The Drager detector tubes also have a relative humidity range of less than 80%. Employee interviews indicate that no one smelled or tasted cyanide or anything else except that the union representative stated that some of the Rohm and Haas employees could smell 81R from the semi-works next to N-5.,exposure to chemical substances

 Load Line Breaks And Injures Worker ,Coastal Electric Cooperative (an electric utility) and Sumter Utilities (an electric power contractor) were installing new utility poles along a highway. An engineer working for the utility went to a jobsite to observe the installation of poles by the contractor. Contractor employees were using a Terex Telelect Commander 4000 digger-derrick mounted on a Marsh Buggy (Model No. WMB50402416PC) to set and remove poles. The workers had positioned the marsh buggy at a bridge. When they were removing an old pole the vehicle facing east stuck in the muddy marsh. The workers tried to get the vehicle turned to the north so that they could more easily extract it from the mud. To rotate the vehicle they used the turret-mount winch on the digger-derrick securing the winch's synthetic rope around a small tree stump and running it under a steel bar welded between the pontoons on the front of the vehicle. The workers turned the vehicle but it slipped back into the rut as the workers started moving it out of the mud. The rope broke and struck the engineer on the left and right forearms and hand. A superintendent for the contractor drove the injured employee to a hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days for lacerations to his forearms a fracture in his left hand and the prevention of infection. (The tree stump had been cut and the rope removed from the winch before the inspection so they could not be examined.),struck by moving objects
 Employee Is Killed In Fall From Derrick ,On August 7 2006 Employee #1 was working in an elevated basket of a deep injection well rig. He was installing an elevator attachment device at the top portion of a drill collar. The basket did not have rails at the area used to attach and separate collars and pipes. While in the basket of the derrick Employee #1 leaned forward to install the elevator to the collar. He wrapped his right arm around the collar and had his left hand on a rope that was around the collar. He pushed the collar with his right shoulder and dropped the rope from his left hand. The momentum and weight of the collar caused Employee #1 to lose his balance and fall forward. He grabbed the elevator with both hands while both his feet remained on the basket for approximately 15 seconds. His feet slipped off the basket and he hung from the elevator by his hands. Employee #1 hugged the top portion of the collar as he slid down approximately 50 ft. His hands slipped off the collar and he fell approximately 70 ft to the steel surface of the derrick.

 Employee Burned In Utility Pole Electric Flash ,On June 23 2003 Employee #1 a lineman and three coworkers were placing new 12 kilovolt conductors on utility poles in Anaheim CA. The existing equipment which had 12 kilovolt circuits needed to be reconfigured to accommodate the new conductors. Employee #1 was in an International bucket truck with a Versalift bucket assembly while one of his coworkers a fifth-stage apprentice worked with hot sticks and rubber gloves on the east side of the pole opposite the bucket. Existing conductors had been placed vertically instead of in the usual horizontal manner so the work involved moving the street side neutral 12 kilovolt conductors to the field side pole pin position. The neutral 12 kilovolt line had an unwanted crimp splice connector sitting atop the insulator so Employee #1 pulled off this connector and clamped down the neutral line in the insulator. He then told the apprentice coworker to climb down since this particular job was completed. The other coworkers a groundman and the foreman were also on the ground. Then for some reason the material handler load indicator contacted the energized phase and a bucket control knob contacted the neutral wire resulting in a phase-to-neutral flash. Employee #1 sustained second- and third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body primarily his upper torso. Subsequent investigation revealed that at some point the insulating line hose covering the field side phase had been removed. Employee #1 was also supposed to be wearing rubber gloves but his apprentice coworker was not sure if this was true.,electrocution
 Electric Shock ,A local utility company hired an electrical contractor to install new streetlighting at the corner of a hazardous intersection. The job required installing one of the streetlights parallel to an existing 13.2-kilovolt (phase-to-phase) overhead power line. The ground worker installed the streetlighting hardware and supply cable on the pole placed a synthetic nylon sling with a choker hitch around the pole and attached the sling to the load line of a derrick truck. When the derrick lifted the pole to an upright position the derrick's tilt-pole plumber arms grasped the shaft of the pole. The operator of the derrick truck swung the load around and began to set the pole in a 1.8-meter-deep hole. The ground worker was securing the cargo straps to the pole trailer as the derrick operator was setting the pole. When the butt end of the pole contacted the bottom of the hole the pole spun the streetlight into the overhead line. The ground worker ran to the pole to try to prevent it from contacting the overhead line. He was electrocuted when he touched the supply cable on the pole. He had entry and exit wounds on his right hand and right heel.,electrocution

 Employee Injured When A Punch Press Actuated ,At approximately 5:00 p.m. on February 26 2002 Employee #1 was working as an operator in Punch Press No. 3C-3 locaed in the stamping shop of the facility. The shop uses punch presses for forming Toyota truck body parts. The machine under consideration is a 300-ton capacity press with 12 to 16 strokes per minute manufactured by Shimomura Press Manufacturing Company of Japan machine model number DCLP-300-22E. The punch press is a part revolution machine with emergency stop pushbuttons installed at five locations including at both hand pushbutton panels. Pressing one of these buttons causes the slide to stop immediately. In order to ensure the safety of the operator during the downward movement of the slide the machine is designed to require the use of both hands to press the pushbuttons continuously until the slide reaches the lower dead point. The machine works two shifts every working day and it makes about 12 different Toyota truck body parts. At the time of the accident Employee #1 was working by himself. The employee had been working in this machine for four years. While changing die for stamping fuel tank upper part number 7711102100 Employee #1 pressed the two (hand) pushbuttons and the slide went down. As he released his hands the slide/die eventually went up. Employee #1 leaned forward (across) to reach the air ejector valve for making some adjustments. At that time the slide came down (for the second time) and struck his right elbow. This amounted to 'double cycling' without actuating the hand push buttons. According to Employee #1 this feature happened a few times in the past. Employee #1 was a regular employee of TABC Inc. Employee #1 was hospitalized in the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center where he was treated for an avulsion fracture of his right elbow soft tissue loss and nerve damage.

 Employee Injured By Chemical Burn From Potassium Hydroxide ,On December 29 2002 Employee #1 a maintenance worker jumped into a tank containing 18 000 gallons of potassium hydroxide. The tank was part of a 13-tank dip tank system used in the manufacture of heavy farm machinery. An unguarded elevated catwalk ran between two of the 18 000-gallon tanks. The tanks were serviced by an overhead crane hoist that moved parts in and out of the tanks. As the crane or hoist traversed the catwalk in its lowered position there were only a few inches of clearance between the crane mechanism and the catwalk. Employee #1 had to make an adjustment to a spray nozzle on one of the tanks. He made an internal calculation that he had enough time to run out on the catwalk and make the repair before the crane or hoist traversed the catwalk again. He misjudged the time he had. While making the repair he turned around and noted that the crane was upon him. Employee #1 had only a split second to determine what to do. Employee #1 stated that he felt his only recourse was to jump into the tank in order to avoid being struck and pinned by the crane or hoist.

 Employee Injured In Fall From Unsecured Trough ,On November 17 1999 Employee #1 and another employee were installing a trough system in the interior of the water treatment containment. The containment was constructed of concrete and formed in the shape of a large cylinder. The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in. bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the trough onto the supports and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the neighboring trough system while another employee tack welded the two troughs systems together. This procedure exposed Employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As Employee #1 stood upon the uneven trough a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing another section of the trough to fall. The steel support that fell was roughly 20 ft away from where he was standing. The trough did not completely sever from all of its supports because the employer had secured the trough with brackets in order to prevent this from occurring. However the fall of the far end of the trough system (which was the system they were attempting to level) causing the rest of the trough system to twist. This twisting action knocked Employee #1 off from where he was positioned. He fell 5.75 ft onto the concrete below striking his head on its surface. The force of the impact on his cerebrum caused hemorrhaging which was not fatal. He was hospitalized for hematoma (the collection of blood resulting from hemorrhaging) and received surgical and postoperative treatment.,collapse of object

 Employee Killed In Fall From Hoist Line On Communication Tow ,On June 25 2006 Employee #1 was part of a crew that was removing antenna equipment from a 1 900-ft communication tower for placement on another tower. One of the workers was on the ground operating the Hydraulic Power Systems Inc. hoisting unit. Two workers were at a height of approximately 1 800 ft on the tower removing the equipment. Once it was free they would connect it to a 5/8-in. nylon rope and the hoist operator would lower it to about the 600 ft level of the tower where Employee #1 was located. He was connected to and suspended by a 1/2 in. wire rope hoist line. Once the equipment reached him he would connect it to the hoist line and the hoist operator would then lower him and the equipment to the ground. Employee #1 would disconnect the equipment and then be raised back up to wait for the next load. During the course of the operations Employee #1 was being raised when the nylon rope broke. The approximately 100 lb equipment attached to the rope fell from approximately 1 800 ft as did a headache ball that was also attached to the rope. The broken end of the rope became tangled on the rigging block that was on top of the tower. This caused the nylon rope to suddenly stop and the shock caused the it to break again at a point just above the headache ball. The nylon rope headache ball and equipment fell until they struck Employee #1 on the hoist line. He was connected to the line with a CM chain repair link that was not designed to be part of a personal fall protection or positioning system. The link separated and Employee #1 fell about 550 ft to the ground. He was killed. Subsequent investigation revealed several problems with the hoisting system: the rigging hoist line and slings that were used to raise personnel had not been installed with a 10:1 safety factor; Employee #1 was on the hoist line while another load was suspended from the same hoist unit; Employee #1 connected his fall protection/positioning device to a shackle above the hook rather than using a lanyard that had been placed directly on the hook; and no anti-two-blocking device was installed on the personnel hoisting line. It was believed that the nylon rope was cut by the wire rope where they both passed through the same double-block rigging device at approximately 500 ft on the tower.,struck by falling object
 Employee Dies After Being Struck By Broken Cable ,At approximately 12:00 p.m. on January 7 2005 Employee #1 was working for Archer Electric Company a licensed machinery rebuilder. He was standing on top of the machine at rail level watching the transmission being installed onto a Wheel True Machine at the truck shop. There were three coworkers standing below the rail lever bolting the transmission to a steel plate with the transmission being held suspended using an overhead crane. A hook was attached to the eyebolt to suspend the load using a steel plate with a hole in the middle. The eyebolt was passed through the hole in the plate and secured on the bottom using a nut and two washers. While the load was suspended inches in the air the eyebolt somehow broke into two pieces causing the wire rope cable to react through the opening creating a helicopter effect. The wire rope cable and/or broken eyebolt/hook struck the employee on the right upper cheekbone knocking him to the floor. Employee #1 was taken to County USC Medical Center by the paramedic where he later died; the cause of death was head trauma. Cal/OSHA determined the accident was caused by the mechanical fatigue of the brand new eyebolt used to connect the load to the crane. The forged steel eyebolt was rated with a work load limit of 4 000 lbs. and the weight of the transmission was determined to be about 600 lbs. at the most. The accident was caused by an unexpected mechanical failure.,struck by falling object
